# Iron-Oxide-Reduction-Three-interface-reaction-kinetics-model
During my master study in Metallurgical Engineering, I had a task on analyzing the Shrinking Core phenomena and developing a model based on the Kinetics Formula. In this code, I created a Python script to describe and calculate the kinetics and also plotted the result in 2D and 3D visualization.

# What you'll see will amaze you, especially if you are starting to learn ferrous metallurgy!
I have coded a script where the visualization of shrinking radius of iron oxide pellet will be animated fully.
And even for another good news is, you can run it yourself! (I have uploaded my script in my Github repository)

# One last message
If you've ever find this work, please do not hesitate to contact me through all available media to discuss Kinetic Model and the scripts!

Lastly, please include citation or sourcing on behalf of this page if you'll ever want to use it fully! ;)
Success to you.
