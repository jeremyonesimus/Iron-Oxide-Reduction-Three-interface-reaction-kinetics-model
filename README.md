# Iron-Oxide-Reduction-Three-interface-reaction-kinetics-model
During my master study in Metallurgical Engineering, I had a task on analyzing the Shrinking Core phenomena and developing a model based on the Kinetics Formula. In this code, I created a Python script to describe and calculate the kinetics and also plotted the result in 2D and 3D visualization.
